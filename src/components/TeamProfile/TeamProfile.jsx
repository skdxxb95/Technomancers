            <p>
              Hello, my name is Sam, and I am originally from Bristol, England. I moved to Australia when I was 6 years old and have spent most of my life in Brisbane. Before receiving my Certificate IV in Cyber Security, I worked in the hospitality industry.         
            <br></br><br></br>
             However, I recently decided to make a change and started a job in Information Technology, as a tech support officer. I am passionate about software development and have decided to pursue it as a profession.            
            <br></br><br></br>
              I have always been interested in technology and have grown to love the endless opportunities and enjoyment that it offers. As a fun fact, I am related to Robert the Bruce, the former king of the Scots, who was famously depicted in the movie Braveheart. But don't worry, I don't have any plans to betray anyone or take their land or freedom!                        
            </p>

            I am Australian born with parents who have a rich mix of nationality including Irish, Indian, Italian, and Scottish. I grew up in Melbourne and after finishing high school I completed two years of further education at TAFE studying office (business) administration.            <br></br>
            <br></br><br></br>
            Since completing further study, I have worked in administration roles in small business such as working as an assistant accountant for a small accounting firm, and an office manager in the textile industry. I then moved on to working in public health care where I have remained for many years. I commenced in payroll and then moved into Human Resources, where I worked in recruitment advertising for several years. While in these roles I completed two Diplomas, Management and Human Resource Management.
            <br></br><br></br>
            I then gravitated towards medical administration specifically with junior doctor recruitment and onboarding in public health. I gained a lot of experience in shortlisting, interviewing, contracting, and onboarding. This role also included supporting other departments with their medical recruitment requirements. I also had the opportunity to step into leadership roles where I lead a team of four (sometimes more) to meet our annual recruitment onboarding goals and project managed our medical careers expo. My experience in this area led to my next career opportunity and my current role.
            <br></br><br></br>
            I now work in private health but remain in medical administration. I support the medical credentialing system for a large private health care organisation. This system is a web-based Software as a Service (Saas). My role is in-house as a system administrator supported by an external software vendor. I can make local configuration updates and improvements as required by the business. My role also involves supporting all the business users of the software, this includes training and supporting users through process improvement.
            <br></br><br></br>
            When I’m not working, I enjoy spending time with my friends and family. I love spending time out in the sun, on the odd occasion it comes out in Melbourne. I am also a big netball fan. I enjoy watching the domestic super netball league as well as international games. My love for netball comes from playing as a child and for many years after high school, where I had a team with friends.

              My nationality is Australian, as is my whole family. I have lived in Bundaberg, Queensland for my whole 21 years of life. My highest level of education is currently Year 12, but I am currently enrolled in both IIT and Programming with RMIT University.
            <br></br><br></br>
            My primary hobby when I am not working retail full time is gaming on my new PC which I built on my own with no experience or help apart from YouTube videos. Otherwise, I am spending time with my partner and our cat, rats, and fish.
            <br></br><br></br>
            IT became a larger part in my life when I realized that my line of work just did not make me happy anymore, friends from my workplace both enrolled with RMIT doing the same courses and informed me of my possibilities within IT.
            <br></br><br></br>
            With that came the urge to build my own PC and enroll shortly after, even with little to no experience, I still want to do the best I can. RMIT was my chosen University as at the time of my enrolment, there was government aid which gave me the final push to commit to these courses.
            <br></br><br></br>
            My expectations are extremely high in learning the inner-workings of IT and increasing my knowledge within the fields of web-development, App-development, both front and back end, alongside understanding more about designing and programming for businesses.

            I am a huge nerd. I love video games and stick more to the mmorpgs as I love the stories and fluff that come with them. I have three cats (1 Adult (Beans) and 2 Kittens (Zort and Lux)).
            <br></br><br></br>
            I am Australian Born and Bred. After completing year 12 in 2000 I went to work in the Trade-Base Timber and Hardware retail, this has continued to current day with little variation. I have completed some Tertiary and Further education over the years;
            <br></br><br></br>
            2022 – First Aid Certificate.<br></br>

            2016 - Certificate II in Skills for Work and Vocational Pathways<br></br>

            2013 - Certificate III in Warehousing Operations.<br></br>

            2011 - Certificate II in Transport and Logistics (Warehousing and Storage).

            <br></br><br></br>
            In my professional career I have focused quite heavily on Integrity of character, Efficiency of task completion, and Honesty in owning my mistakes. I have made it a personal mission not to engage in office politics as I have found that it serves no purpose but to breed hate and discontent.

            I’ve always been willing to give anything a go. I think my resume reflects that. I taught music some years ago from mid year for 6 months at a P-12 school when they were unable to get a qualified music teacher. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            Mostly to the secondary pupils but a few hours with a large group of the primary school age students. It was a lot of fun.
            It was a job that I look back fondly at and would not hesitate to do again.
            <br></br><br></br>
            I also worked and trained in viticulture and enology, the whole range of the wine making process from growing the grapes to producing the wine.
            <br></br><br></br>
            I play music fairly regularly either on my own, with my band, Ally And The Cats or as a back up musician and vocalist. With the new knowledge I am currently acquiring I will soon get a music website up and running. For now I just have a Facebook page.
            <br></br><br></br>
            I am involved in some environmental projects including Habitat 141 with Greening Australia which aims to create a wildlife corrider from the River Murray to the coast. Interested in all things recyclable, reuseable and sustainable, and renewable energies.

            <p>
              I'm Brodie, I'm 27 years old and I was born in Far North Queensland, Australia. I grew up on a 
              sugar cane farm, in a village of 300 people. My first introduction to anything technology wise was
              watching my friend's older brothers playing games on the computer, and teaching me how to take care
              of our home computer by running disk optimisations and waiting for it to load correctly before use.            
            <br></br><br></br>
              Eventually, I was drawn in to programming and networking by taking ICT in high school on the Sunshine
              Coast. I never took IT at university, which is something I regret. However, I never forgot how much
              I loved the feeling of solving a programming problem or understanding how a network functions.             
            <br></br><br></br>
              When I was 21, I applied for a Sales position at an IT company, and was shocked when the owner called
              and asked me to apply for the role of Lead Web Developer, despite only casually learning web development
              online and working as a security guard at the time. I applied and was successful, and spent the next 4
              years working closely with software and web developers. It drew me to the field even further, and after
              another small stint in security, settled on formally studying software development at a university.             
            <br></br><br></br>
              Now, I am studying online at RMIT whilst living in Manchester, England with my fiance and our two year
              old daughter. I love studying online and I love RMIT, I can't wait for each new term to learn something
              completely different.
