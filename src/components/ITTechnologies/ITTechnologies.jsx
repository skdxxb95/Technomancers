            <h2>IT Technologies - Machine Learning</h2>
            <p>Machine learning falls into a subset of artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is a form of computer systems that can perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence. Machine learning is an avenue of making machines have the ability to learn and think and develop themselves. Machine learning is in the area of coding and teaching computer systems to complete task or work and improve on their own.</p>
            <p>Algorithms are created by machine learning that helps machines better understand and comprehend data. This in turn can allow for machines to then interpret data and make decisions based on the data outcomes. ​(Great Learning Team, 2022)</p>
            <p>Machine learning technology can already be found in wide ranging industries including banking and industrial plants.</p>
            <p>Cyber security is an emerging state of art area for machine learning. In an ever-increasing critical area of the internet, machine learning is contributing to improve anti-virus software and models that can look for and stop potential cyber-attacks. This may also alert users and business and minimise threats. ​(Omdena, 2022)​ ​(Marktechpost, 2022)​</p>
            <p>Already, machine learning can be found in many industries. For example, in toys such as HelloBarbie.</p>
            <p>This doll that is targeted for children, the Barbie is able to record what words are spoken and send to a server. From the server, the words and data can be analysed and can decide on a response to questions asked by the child. It can answer questions like what is their favourite food. And the information stored can be used later on for other questions asked by the child.</p>
            <p>American Express operationally have over a trillion transactions to analyse. To safeguard their customer cards they rely on system algorithms to analyse transactional data and detect fraud in real time. ​(Mar, 2019)​</p>
            <p>In healthcare, in particular the area of radiology, computer systems and algorithms have been written to read patient’s CT scans and look for predetermined anomalies on scan data. This is particularly important in locations like China for instance where there are shortages of radiologists. This machine learning technology is also critical in reducing human error. When there are high volumes of CT scans that require review, the issue of fatigue by the radiologist can lead to mistakes, which in turn can lead to patients with life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, being undiagnosed.</p>
            <p>Image recognition is a notable example of current machine learning technology in use today. It can read and detect features from an image or an object in a digital image. This technology can then be used for face recognition. This approach involves extracting key features from images and then using this data in other machine learning models. An example of this is used by Facebook. Your own image can be identified in uploaded pictures and then the algorithms ask the use ‘is this you?’. And the user can then make further decisions based on this.</p>
            <p>Further to image recognition, there is video surveillance machine learning technology. In addition to facial feature detection, video surveillance data also includes audio. The algorithms can look at the presence of humans in particular images and track movements and to then learn from the movements and identify humans. </p>
            <p>Machine Learning technology is currently used in online map services like google maps. Machine learning algorithms explore traffic and road data and have learnt to compare route guidance against traffic congestion and can provide the user with different route navigation options.</p> 
            <p>Innovative organisations are realising the importance of the area of artificial intelligence and machine learning, and are already increasing plans to integrate some form into their processes in the future. In particular, the areas of business analyse, risk assessment, research, and development. This of course results in significant costs savings to businesses.</p>
            <p>Business will need to ensure that they understand artificial intelligence and machine learning well and employ the right people to lead this new area of technology. ​(Simplilearn, 2022)​</p>
            <p>We are also seeing this emerging technology in warfare such as with drones and naval ships that are unmanned. This is in use now in the war in Ukraine. And engineers in a college in China are building “hunting algorithms” for use on unmanned vessels of war intended to hunt down targets. ​(The Economist, 2022)​</p>
            <p>Further research in machine learning will assist in its development. And as this technology becomes more integrated into everyday business life, more avenue for improving business process will immerge. Regulations in artificial intelligence and machine learning will also have an impact of the developments of this technology.</p>
            <p>The impact of machine learning technology is large and far reaching. It will impact everyone. We are already benefiting from the machine learning technology in our everyday lives. With widespread use of the internet machine learning algorithms assist with presenting advertising tailored to our usage data and can provide suggestions on products such as restaurants, beauty products, clothing, toys, art, for example.</p>
            <p>Further improvements to driver assistance technology in the automotive industry that exists in modern cars today will make our roads safer and save lives. Currently we are already utilising technology that can scan the road and warn the driver of lane departure or oncoming traffic or parked cars.</p>
            <p>The same can be said for improvements that will come from machine learning technology in health care. In relation to improvements with robots in surgery, the technology will be able to assist to reduce errors in surgery where surgical robots are used. This will lead to better patient outcomes and again can save lives.</p>
            <p>Algorithms of medical data in medical research has the potential to provide greater insights to doctors and provide the information much quicker. </p> 
            <p>By transforming industries including health care, automotive, and manufacturing for example it has the potential to affect everyone. It will improve the services and quality of products and help with earlier diagnosis of disease in health care.</p>
            <p>I do believe that machine learning technologies will make some roles redundant. It may reduce the human resources required as it improves business processes in all areas. For jobs in automotive and manufacturing, machine learning will be able to replace roles that are higher risk or dangerous.</p>
            <p>We will see improvements with our daily lives as the technology in machine learning evolves.</p>
            <p>Depending on the industry you work in the impact may be different. In some instances where machine learning may replace or reduce staff, some people may become redundant and required to find a new job or will be out of work. This leads to socio economic issues that will need to be addressed by society as part of the changes and improvements in machine learning.</p>
            <p>For those who may no longer have a job the difference can be devastating. In particular for unskilled workers who are then unable to find work. Especially if this comes at a time where there may be rapid growth in the area of machine learning. It may lead to large scale job losses in sectors, and this puts pressure on governments and our economy when unemployment is high.</p>
            <p>The speed of machine learning technology in the military space is the area of change that may be considered most concerning. Most large armed forces are already delivering on unmanned objects of war and weaponised drones and vessels. The outcome of which could lead to more casualties of war or in the hypothetical sensationalised case of the premise described in the movies starting with Terminator 1 ​(The Terminator, 1984)​, could machine learning evolve to a point of removing human decision making from military devices? Seems unlikely however the rapid rise in development and research in this area has immense potential and concern.</p>
