            <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
            <p>Machine learning falls into a subset of artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is a form of computer systems that can perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence. Machine learning is an avenue of making machines have the ability to learn and think and develop themselves. Machine learning is in the area of coding and teaching computer systems to complete task or work and improve on their own.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>Algorithms are created by machine learning that helps machines better understand and comprehend data. This in turn can allow for machines to then interpret data and make decisions based on the data outcomes. ​(Great Learning Team, 2022)</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>Machine learning technology can already be found in wide ranging industries including banking and industrial plants.</p>
            <p>Cyber security is an emerging state of art area for machine learning. In an ever-increasing critical area of the internet, machine learning is contributing to improve anti-virus software and models that can look for and stop potential cyber-attacks. This may also alert users and business and minimise threats. ​(Omdena, 2022)​ ​(Marktechpost, 2022)​</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>Already, machine learning can be found in many industries. For example, in toys such as HelloBarbie.</p>
            <p>This doll that is targeted for children, the Barbie is able to record what words are spoken and send to a server. From the server, the words and data can be analysed and can decide on a response to questions asked by the child. It can answer questions like what is their favourite food. And the information stored can be used later on for other questions asked by the child.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>American Express operationally have over a trillion transactions to analyse. To safeguard their customer cards they rely on system algorithms to analyse transactional data and detect fraud in real time. ​(Mar, 2019)​</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>In healthcare, in particular the area of radiology, computer systems and algorithms have been written to read patient’s CT scans and look for predetermined anomalies on scan data. This is particularly important in locations like China for instance where there are shortages of radiologists. This machine learning technology is also critical in reducing human error. When there are high volumes of CT scans that require review, the issue of fatigue by the radiologist can lead to mistakes, which in turn can lead to patients with life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, being undiagnosed.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>Image recognition is a notable example of current machine learning technology in use today. It can read and detect features from an image or an object in a digital image. This technology can then be used for face recognition. This approach involves extracting key features from images and then using this data in other machine learning models. An example of this is used by Facebook. Your own image can be identified in uploaded pictures and then the algorithms ask the use ‘is this you?’. And the user can then make further decisions based on this.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>Further to image recognition, there is video surveillance machine learning technology. In addition to facial feature detection, video surveillance data also includes audio. The algorithms can look at the presence of humans in particular images and track movements and to then learn from the movements and identify humans. </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>Machine Learning technology is currently used in online map services like google maps. Machine learning algorithms explore traffic and road data and have learnt to compare route guidance against traffic congestion and can provide the user with different route navigation options.</p> 
            <br></br>
            <p>Innovative organisations are realising the importance of the area of artificial intelligence and machine learning, and are already increasing plans to integrate some form into their processes in the future. In particular, the areas of business analyse, risk assessment, research, and development. This of course results in significant costs savings to businesses.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>Business will need to ensure that they understand artificial intelligence and machine learning well and employ the right people to lead this new area of technology. ​(Simplilearn, 2022)​</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>We are also seeing this emerging technology in warfare such as with drones and naval ships that are unmanned. This is in use now in the war in Ukraine. And engineers in a college in China are building “hunting algorithms” for use on unmanned vessels of war intended to hunt down targets. ​(The Economist, 2022)​</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>Further research in machine learning will assist in its development. And as this technology becomes more integrated into everyday business life, more avenue for improving business process will immerge. Regulations in artificial intelligence and machine learning will also have an impact of the developments of this technology.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>The impact of machine learning technology is large and far reaching. It will impact everyone. We are already benefiting from the machine learning technology in our everyday lives. With widespread use of the internet machine learning algorithms assist with presenting advertising tailored to our usage data and can provide suggestions on products such as restaurants, beauty products, clothing, toys, art, for example.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>Further improvements to driver assistance technology in the automotive industry that exists in modern cars today will make our roads safer and save lives. Currently we are already utilising technology that can scan the road and warn the driver of lane departure or oncoming traffic or parked cars.</p>
            <p>The same can be said for improvements that will come from machine learning technology in health care. In relation to improvements with robots in surgery, the technology will be able to assist to reduce errors in surgery where surgical robots are used. This will lead to better patient outcomes and again can save lives.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>Algorithms of medical data in medical research has the potential to provide greater insights to doctors and provide the information much quicker. </p> 
            <p>By transforming industries including health care, automotive, and manufacturing for example it has the potential to affect everyone. It will improve the services and quality of products and help with earlier diagnosis of disease in health care.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>I do believe that machine learning technologies will make some roles redundant. It may reduce the human resources required as it improves business processes in all areas. For jobs in automotive and manufacturing, machine learning will be able to replace roles that are higher risk or dangerous.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>We will see improvements with our daily lives as the technology in machine learning evolves.</p>
            <p>Depending on the industry you work in the impact may be different. In some instances where machine learning may replace or reduce staff, some people may become redundant and required to find a new job or will be out of work. This leads to socio economic issues that will need to be addressed by society as part of the changes and improvements in machine learning.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>For those who may no longer have a job the difference can be devastating. In particular for unskilled workers who are then unable to find work. Especially if this comes at a time where there may be rapid growth in the area of machine learning. It may lead to large scale job losses in sectors, and this puts pressure on governments and our economy when unemployment is high.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>The speed of machine learning technology in the military space is the area of change that may be considered most concerning. Most large armed forces are already delivering on unmanned objects of war and weaponised drones and vessels. The outcome of which could lead to more casualties of war or in the hypothetical sensationalised case of the premise described in the movies starting with Terminator 1 ​(The Terminator, 1984)​, could machine learning evolve to a point of removing human decision making from military devices? Seems unlikely however the rapid rise in development and research in this area has immense potential and concern.</p>

            <h2>Autonomous Vehicles</h2>
            <p>Since 1939 the race has been on for the first company to create a functioning autonomous vehicle, GM created the very first self-driving vehicle, which was guided by radio-controlled, electromagnetic fields, generated with magnetized metal spikes embedded within the length of the roadway. However, this concept was not yet fully operational until almost 20 years later in 1958, the vehicle’s front end was fitted with sensors that could detect the flowing current through a wire planted in the road. Fast-forward 6 decades and the state-of-the-art autonomous vehicle Is much more capable than simply traversing the length of wire-embedded roadways, among the 25.14-billion-dollar worldwide market value for autonomous vehicles, as of today, Tesla has created the most advanced auto vehicle with the Model S. Today’s technologies have led to the making of a vehicle built from the ground up being only powered by electricity,  with a range of 396 miles to a full charge and the ability to go from 0 to 96 km per hour, the Tesla Model S marks the highest reaching point for current autonomous vehicle creation. Fully autonomous vehicles have the capability to perform not only basic driving tasks such as; fully driver-less driving, breaking and parking, they can also perform much more intense evasive maneuverers and lifesaving driving techniques with the help of; sensors, actuators, complex algorithms, machine learning systems and powerful processors. While speed and acceleration are key talking points when discussing electric, self-driving vehicles, the large amount of safety benefits associated with driverless- cars are far more important. The general agreement amongst Australian and international experts are that 90% of all accidents could be eliminated through advanced driverless vehicle technology. With the large array of sensors imbedded in driverless vehicles, it is virtually impossible for any minor incidents to occur, while also predicting any collisions coming up ahead that the human brain is simply not capable of doing. Human error is one of the leading causes of practically all traffic accidents; by removing the risk of delayed reactions or other human errors, I.e., falling asleep at the wheel, the chance of human contributed accidents is greatly reduced. Globally in 2019, there was an estimated 31.4 million autonomous vehicles on the road, and it was shown to incline to a total of 43.57 million by the end of 2022 (Titlemax, 2022), this is thanks to the continuously proven benefits of owning an AI vehicle but mainly because most of these vehicles run on electric power which drastically saves customer’s money over time. Within the foreseeable future, alongside multiple companies, such as Apple, planning to roll out their own AI vehicles, the autonomous vehicles of the future will have a heavier level of reliability on camera-based technology, this focus comes after the use of; multiple signals, including cameras, lidar, radar and digital maps has been considered outdated by multiple scientists and AI vehicle companies. The hopes for camera input only comes with the continued evidence that with enough inputted data and computing power, alongside the right deep learning architecture, artificial intelligent systems will have the capability to do things we thought were previously impossible (ADAS and Autonomous Vehicles, 2022). The leaders in the camera only movement are Tesla, spokespersons from Tesla have spoken out about how the company is using neural networks and camera input to estimate depth, velocity and required acceleration. Tesla is also the only company that has full power over the entire hardware and software stacks, they use these stacks to continue to teach and train their deep learning modules, which when added to camera only technology will only push them further in the evolution of driverless vehicles(Tesla, 2020). Whatever the future has planned for AI vehicles, it isn’t a stretch to say that Tesla will still be leading the pack.</p><br></br>

            <p>With the greater number of autonomous vehicles on the road, there will no doubt be a large amount of positive and negative impacts associated with this, these impacts greatly affect the areas of; Livability, economic and environmental. Autonomous vehicles greatly account for a decline of noise pollution in many local and urban areas, by removing regular petroleum-based engines, the benefits are also astronomical to countless varieties of wildlife (TMR QLD, 2021). Without the need for an exhaust system in place, autonomous/electric vehicles create zero exhaust commissions, these emissions include; Carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds and sulfur dioxide and when mixed with sunlight and warm temperatures, form a ground-level ozone (ANZ Driverless Vehicle Initiative, 2022). However, with the removal of engines from most autonomous vehicles being mostly positive, this does also bring it’s share of negative impacts, in most countries, renewable energy is used to charge electric engines, however, in several US countries, for example, most of their energy is still being generated by coal plants, which in turn, makes driving AI vehicles much less sustainable than those relying on renewable energy (EARTH.ORG, 2022). Recent human rights concerns have sparked following the need for cobalt batteries in AI vehicles, these concerns stem for the fact that the largest cobalt mines are within The Democratic Republic of Congo, these mines use artisanal miners and expose them to severally dangerous conditions. With approximately 200,000 Artisanal miners working in the Congo alone and without any form of safety protection, it is estimated that up to 2,000 of these illegal miners are dying every year without being recorded(CNBC, 2021). Looking on the lighter side, without the need for full, able-bodied drivers behind the wheel, autonomous vehicles give disabled drivers the chance of easily accessible mobility once again with the help of our ever-evolving feats of technology. A commonly heard about fear is that thousands of workers will be kicked out of their jobs due to the redundancy levels associated with the lack of petrol vehicles, it is also fact that with the autonomous vehicle industry growing faster than ever before, thousands of more jobs and completely new career opportunities will become available to both experienced and non-experienced workers within the automobile industry. With new jobs also brings forward the need for newer technologies, Vehicle-to-Vehicle technology communication is the potential next stage in building the technology required for AI vehicles. This enables connected vehicles to exchange information through a wireless network about factors such as; position, speed, direction, braking and acceleration.</p><br></br>

            <p>With the changes coming forward with AI vehicles, the impact in which it will have on my future will mainly be the need to invest in an electric/AI vehicle, this comes with the fantastic financial benefits associated with this purchase, the average Australian spends an average of $1465 annually on fuel costs alone (Compare the Market, 2022), with fuel prices constantly rising, it is becoming impractical to continue owning petrol based vehicles in the distant future. With the use of home charging and the installation of solar panels on your home, the need to take time from your day to wait around charging your autonomous vehicle, especially if you have a busy work/life schedule like myself, will greatly increase the amount of time in which can be invested in much more important daily activities, I.e. Family, work, medical  appointments. This is one of the leading reasons in which I can see the need for myself to buy an AI vehicle. Congestion in early morning traffic can also be painful when commuting to my workplace, owning an Ai vehicle completely takes off all stresses of navigating through the busiest parts of traffic and takes all the stress of traversing to what may be a much more stressful day ahead, I know for myself that stress is a key problem in my current workplace and is unhealthy to continue to not find alternative solutions for this. With stress taken out of the equation, my focus can be solely placed on the most challenging of problems within my field of work, which in turn leads to an overall better way of living and this is all thanks to the revolutionary technology imbedded within AI vehicles. With multiple members of my family and a handful of my friends not having the capabilities to operate a motor vehicle, having the accessibility to an AI vehicle will also greatly improve their way of life when needed to perform tasks that others see as simple or straightforward, where they see it as one of the many difficult challenges associated with their daily routines.</p><br></br>

            <h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
            <p>   
            <p>Cybersecurity is a practice of enforcing policies and protocols to guard sensitive digital information from bad actors and malicious intent. It is how companies and organisations protect themselves from these threats. The history of cyber security originates in the 1970’s. A man named Bob Thomas realised it was possible for programs to move overnetworks, and so created a program named The Creeper. Simply, it moved across networks and left a message: “Hi! I’m The Creeper! Catch me if you can!”. This raised many concerns, specifically to another man, named Ray Tomlinson, famous for developing email. He created a program to hunt down and delete Creeper, a self-replicating program named The Reaper. In the process, Tomlinson also created the world’s first worm program. He simultaneously created the world’s first antivirus, and the origin of the world’s first malicious virus, later being The Morrison Worm.(cyber-security.degree; FBI.gov)</p><br></br>

            <p>Modern day viruses are many, as the number of machines used to access the information super highway numbers in the billions. The most dangerous of these viruses today are the Zeus Gameover; which disguises itself as legitimate software and steals bank details, and does not require a centralized server to send the details back, making it effectively untraceable; IoT device attacks, which target devices connected to the Internet of Things, such as modern cars, houses that run on a home network device, even as far as pacemakers and other medical equipment. Viruses and other malware programs are always going to be a part of software and computing, which is why modern day advancements in cyber security are always required.(safetydetectives.com)/</p><br></br>

            <p>Computer hacking is the idea of entering into a computer network without permission to do so. There are many different tools that hackers use. Some of these include; Botnets (a botnet is a network of computers running bots under the control of a bot herder), Browser hijacks, Denial of Service Attacks (DDoS stands for Distributed Denial of Service. This type of attack involves sending large amounts of traffic from multiple sources to a service or website, intending to overwhelm it), Ransomware, Rootkits (are a kind of malware that can give a threat actor control of your computer without your consent or knowledge), Trojan Horse, Viruses and Worms.(malwarebytes.com)</p><br></br>

            <p>Many modern day governments and militaries have chosen to employ notorious or criminal hackers into their ranks to use cyber based warfare against enemy factions, with many predicting that the future of warfare lies in that of the cyber world. When considering that over several pedabytes of data is transmitting across the internet every second, it is understandable why certain factions would want to monitor this information for potential threats. </p><br></br>

            <p>Currently, cybersecurity advancements are being made everyday, with blockchain technologies being the forefront of these current advancements. Blockchain technology is the practice of securing large groups of data together and connecting them via cryptography, making it near impossible for hackers to break in. Of course, this leads to other means of hacking such as social engineering, to gain access by influencing the humans working on the tasks. </p><br></br>

            <p>There are other drawbacks, such as the current inefficiency of the technology or the costs needed to implement it. Other cybersecurity network improvements are protocols such as Zero Trust, which require all users to authenticate themselves to a greater extent before allowing them into the network, thereby reducing the chances of an anonymous bad actor gaining access and causing damage to the network before escaping.</p><br></br>

            <p>Zero Trust technology raises many ethical and philosophical questions, such as how far will technology go before each human being is given a unique identifier, effectively reducing human beings down to a complex series of alphanumeric codes, and making it so that each person is tracked and tagged, in order to access modern technology. There are other questions as well such as that of privacy. If a user’s data is forever linked to a unique identifier, then there will always be a record of their digital footprint. Each person’s thoughts, feelings and curiosities will always be available in a digital format, despite reassurances of privacy and inaccessibility. </p><br></br>

            <p>The impact this would have on society as a whole would be unthinkable, as it would reshape our very definitions of rights to privacy, individuality and trust. In order to be granted a high-ranking government position, for example, would a person’s entire digital footprint need to be examined? If so, by whom? Would there be tiers of trust and acceptability in order to work specific jobs? Or live in certain areas? Many of these concerns are shared and outlined in modern media such as Black Mirror or Mr. Robot, however, the real life implications and potential ramifications are far reaching and near impossible to fully comprehend. As technology increases, so does our seeming dependence upon it, so does the potential damage that can be caused by bad actors and malicious intent. There may come a time where a job such as a data filterer may exist, one who has to meticulously comb through a person’s digital footprint for potentially undesirable traits or influences. </p><br></br>

            <p>Cybersecurity as it currently exists today will eventually be seen as primitive, as a by-product of a hybrid world that was still able to exist offline, and one where a user’s device or data being lost or damaged would not be life changing. One where a person could still choose to remain largely offline, with only convenience being impacted. Cybersecurity will inevitably march in lock-step with each technological advancement, as it will inevitably pertain to the safety and livelihoods of those who depend on it. Each step forward in medical, transport and utilities that rely on technology will also rely as heavily on cybersecurity, otherwise entire cities and millions of lives could be at stake. Just as a wooden lock was designed to protect a family living inside of a wooden house, so too will cybersecurity be used to protect families and people living inside of an ever-increasing digital world. </p><br></br>
