                Overall, the group assignment was a success with active and engaged team members from the start. The team was well-organized and able to work efficiently together. All members were willing to share their ideas and contribute to the project. This helped us to complete the task faster than expected. The team was able to divide the work into smaller chunks and assign them to individual members, which helped to keep everyone on the same page. However, there were some areas for improvement, such as punctuality for meetings. Sometimes team members were late for the meetings, including myself, which caused delays and made it harder for us to stay on schedule. This could be improved by setting a reminder for the meetings and sending out an agenda beforehand, so everyone could come prepared. One surprising aspect was the team's ability to quickly learn and become proficient in new skills, such as React. React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, which was new to most of the team members. But the team picked up the library quickly and were able to contribute to a user-friendly interface in a short amount of time. This was a great learning experience for all of us. I thought the GitHub activity log reflected the distribution of work accurately throughout the group. It helped us to keep track of the progress of the project and to identify any issues that needed to be addressed. It also allowed us to see who was contributing the most and who might need additional support. In conclusion, this group assignment was a great learning experience. It taught me the importance of clear communication and organization in group work. Overall, I feel that the group worked well together and was able to complete the assignment successfully.
